  False positives already in GCC bugzilla:
    FALSE: pack-revindex.c:250:20: warning: check of ‘data’ for NULL after already dereferencing it [-Wanalyzer-deref-before-check]
      the check is in a "cleanup:" section which can be reached from various places in supergraph; "data" might or might not be NULL
      https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=108455

  False positives not yet in GCC bugzilla:
    FALSE: http-fetch.c:66:21: warning: use of uninitialized value ‘results.curl_result’ [CWE-457] [-Wanalyzer-use-of-uninitialized-value]
    FALSE: fsmonitor-settings.c:208:9: warning: leak of ‘strdup(path)’ [CWE-401] [-Wanalyzer-malloc-leak]
      Suspected dup of PR analyzer/108252.
    FALSE: run-command.c:328:12: warning: leak of file descriptor ‘dup2(fd,  to)’ [CWE-775] [-Wanalyzer-fd-leak]
    FALSE: builtin/archive.c:17:20: warning: leak of file descriptor ‘dup2(output_fd, 1)’ [CWE-775] [-Wanalyzer-fd-leak]
      It calls "die_errno" when failing, so the "leak" is uninteresting.
      Also, perhaps code is making an assumption about lowest-numbered unused file descriptor which analyzer doesn't know about

    FALSE: builtin/show-ref.c:194:20: warning: check of ‘argv’ for NULL after already dereferencing it [-Wanalyzer-deref-before-check]


  Genuine -Wanalyzer-deref-before-check issues:
    TRUE: reftable/block.c:446:12: warning: check of ‘blockp’ for NULL after already dereferencing it [-Wanalyzer-deref-before-check]

  TRUE: reftable/publicbasics.c:43:9: warning: use of possibly-NULL ‘p’ where non-null expected [CWE-690] [-Wanalyzer-possible-null-argument]
